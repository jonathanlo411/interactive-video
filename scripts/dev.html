                <p>
                    <em><p>Singularity is an open-source container engine designed to bring operating system-level virtualization to scientific and high-performance computing. With Singularity you can package complex computational workflows --- software applications, libraries, and data --- in a simple, portable, and reproducible way, which can then be run almost anywhere. Once you've created your Singularity container, you can run it on the workstation in your lab, on a virtual machine in the public cloud, or on the world's largest supercomputers. Singularity is all about the mobility of compute. <br><br>In this webinar, we'll provide an overview of Singularity and how you might incorporate the use of containers in your own research. We'll also show you how to access and use some of the containerized applications that we make available to users on Expanse at SDSC. <br><br></p></em>

            </h2>
            <p>
                <em><p>Jupyter notebooks have become the de facto standard interface for web-based interactive computing. However, whenever you launch and run a Jupyter notebook server on any remote compute resource, whether on a virtual machine from a public cloud provider or on a high-performance computing system like Expanse, additional security measures must be employed to protect the privacy and integrity of the data exchanged over the public internet between the notebook server and your local web browser. If such security measures are not taken, you not only put your own research code and data at risk of network eavesdropping and data tampering by malicious actors, but you may also inadvertently expose every other researcher using a shared compute resource like Expanse to these types of serious cyberthreats should your user account be compromised. <br><br>In this webinar, we’ll provide you with an overview of when-to, how-to, and how-not-to secure your Jupyter notebook sessions. Most importantly, we’ll introduce you to SDSC’s Satellite reverse proxy service and its new client-side application, galyleo. Together, they will help you launch your Jupyter notebook sessions on Expanse in a simple, secure way, so you can focus on getting your research done rather than Jupyter notebook security.</p></em>

                    <em>This webinar provides an introduction to massively parallel computing with graphics processing units (GPUs) on the SDSC Comet supercomputer. The use of GPUs is becoming increasingly popular across all scientific domains since GPUs can significantly accelerate time to solution for many computational tasks. In this webinar, participants will learn how to access Comet GPU nodes, how to launch GPU jobs on Comet, and get introduced to GPU programming. The webinar will cover the essential background of GPU chip architectures and the basics of programming GPUs via the use of libraries, OpenACC compiler directives, and the CUDA programming language. The participants will thus acquire the foundation to use and develop GPU aware applications. </em>
